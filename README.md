## 📋 About the Project

This project demonstrates automated E2E testing of key user flows on the [www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com) website, including:

- 🔐 User authentication (login / logout)
- 🛍️ Adding and removing items from the shopping cart
- 💳 Checkout flow (customer details → order summary → order confirmation)

The tests are written using the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern for maintainability and clarity.

### Tech Stack

| Tool | Version |
|---|---|
| [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) | ^1.59.1 |
| TypeScript | via `@types/node` |
| Node.js | LTS |
| dotenv | ^17.4.2 |

### CI/CD

Tests are automatically executed on every push and pull request to the `main` / `master` branch via **GitHub Actions**. Test credentials are stored securely as GitHub Secrets in the `TEST` environment.

## 🚀 Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lazovskih/online_store_playwright.git
cd online_store_playwright
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

### 3. Install Playwright browsers

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # if an example file is available, otherwise create manually
```

Add your credentials to `.env`:

```env
STANDARD_USER=set_username
DEMO_PASSWORD=set_password
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file.** It is already listed in `.gitignore`.
